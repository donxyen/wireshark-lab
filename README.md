## 🎯 Objective
This Wireshark lab is to gain hands-on experience using **Wireshark** to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic. This project focuses on understanding **packet structures, network protocols, and communication flows** to identify anomalies, suspicious activity, and potential security threats within network data.  

## 🔑 Key Skills
- **Wireshark Configuration & UI Customization** – Create and manage profiles, add custom columns, and tailor layouts for efficient packet analysis.  
- **Traffic Filtering & Display Rules** – Use advanced display filters to isolate specific hosts, protocols, and conversations.  
- **Packet Capture Techniques** – Learn where and how to capture network traffic effectively for different environments.  
- **Understanding Packet Anatomy** – Analyze how encapsulation works across layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, Application).  
- **IP Traffic Analysis** – Identify source/destination addresses, TTL, fragmentation, and routing behavior.  
- **UDP & TCP Analysis** – Inspect connectionless vs. connection-oriented protocols, detect handshake anomalies, and identify retransmissions or resets.  
- **Protocol Decoding** – Interpret HTTP, DNS, ARP, ICMP, and TLS traffic to understand network behavior.  
- **Traffic Coloring & Visualization** – Apply color rules and filter buttons to quickly recognize packet types and anomalies.  
- **Network Troubleshooting** – Diagnose latency, dropped packets, and misconfigured services through detailed packet inspection.  
- **Threat Detection Fundamentals** – Recognize signs of scanning, spoofing, DoS, and suspicious payload activity within captured traffic.
